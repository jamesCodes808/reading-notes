# Wireframes and HTML

## Class 4 - Structure Web Pages with HTML

Wireframes and design are important elements of web development. A wireframe is 
a visual representation of a website's structure and layout, showing the 
arrangement of elements such as text, images, and buttons. This allows designers 
and developers to plan the layout and functionality of a website before building 
it, ensuring that it is user-friendly and meets the needs of the intended 
audience.

### Some popular wireframes are:

- Google Drawings
- Invision
- Balsamiq

In addition to wireframes, design is also an important aspect of web 
development. Design includes elements such as color, typography, and imagery, 
and plays a crucial role in creating an engaging and visually appealing user 
experience.

In summary, wireframes and design are crucial elements of web development, 
allowing designers and developers to plan and create user-friendly and visually 
appealing websites. The use of semantic HTML is also important for accessibility 
and search engine optimization.
