## Pain Vs. Suffering


- Whatâ€™s your perspective?

My perspective of the pain that goes into mentally and physically pushing yourself to learn, absorb, progress and build a solid foundation in a fast paced learning and working environment is that sometimes it is necessary. I have gone through a lot of pain in mostly all of my positions. I seldom held a job where I wasn't being challenged to grow or endure some type of pain for progress.

- Why are you doing this?

I am doing this because of my personality type and ambition. I cannot have a job that is unfulfilling and not challenging me to learn and grow. I also am doing this to achieve my dream job and obtain a better life and environment for me and my daughter.

- Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?

I want what comes at the end of this journey and will continue to keep striving to obtain what comes after the end of the journey.

- Are you doing this for you?

I am doing this mainly for myself but also for my daughter. 


## Things I want to know more about

- A deeper understanding of Big O and algorithms. I definitely want to at least be comfortable enough to reference it by memory
