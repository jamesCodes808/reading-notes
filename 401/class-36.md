## What are the key pieces of advice mentioned in the “Whiteboard Advice” reading assignment for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews?

- Communicate
Think out loud so the interviewer can hear and see your thought process. This can also help with you understanding something you might not had understood initially.

- Ask questions
Ask questions whenever you are confused, especially when it comes to test cases. This will allow you to see what kind of data you are preparing to work with and what that data might do.


- Write Pseudocode
Write out pseudocode almost like steps for the real code. Ask the interviewer if it makes sense before proceeding. 

- Ask for help
Phrase questions conversationally to clarify the problem. 

## From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

- Write down the steps of the solution
Writing down the steps to the solution gives me a better understanding of how I am going to code a problem out. Before even tackling the code, steps or pseudocode are extremely important for paving the way. 


- Sit down. Be humble
We are all human and although the interview might be scary, they are human as well and just want the best for you if you are able to pass. They are able to help and will want to help so don't refuse the help and be open to their thoughts and ideas, it can help.
