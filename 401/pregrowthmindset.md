# Pre: Growth Mindset

## Growth Mindset With Technical Skills

After reading the article 'Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice' it definitely inspired me to stay strong with a growth mindset. In the past courses, there are some assignments where I did the stretch goal tasks and some assignments where I did not. I did not do them simply because I spent too much time trying to figure out how to do them. 

For these stretch goals, I was met with uncomfortable situations that would take my effort and time to figure out and complete. 

Going forward I definitely want to embrace these situations more for the personal reward, growth and gain. 

## Emotional Intelligence

Taking the emotional intelligence assessment I have learned that I am competent in self-awareness and self-management. I am lacking in social awareness and relationship management. I agree with this assessment and know that there are many things that I need to work on personally. I need to be more aware of being able to read and empathize with others as well as handle conflicts that may not be my own. 

## Bias 

For my bias assessment I scored pretty well in every category. This does not surprise me as I do not have many biases and am mostly open-minded. Even when a person or situation may seem bad, I try to stay open-minded and try to think of different reasons why a person may be acting the way that they do. But overrall I am a pretty inclusive person and because of my upbringing and ethnicity I do pretty well in a diverse or non-diverse crowd.
