# Open-Source Software Contribution

When it comes to open-source software contribution, I think the biggest misconception is that you have to contribute 
whole features and blocks of code. This is not the case. Contribution to open-source software can be a contribution 
of any size and of any magnitude, whether it is 3 lines of code or just adding in a note where you may seem fit in 
the documentation. 

After browsing through some of these articles, one of the best things a first time contributor can do is to find a 
beginner-friendly project, specifically one in a language they are familiar with, and just look through the code to 
see what needs changing, or what can be refactored even. Do not be afraid to clone a repo down, take a look at the 
code and just start contributing. It may be scary at first but the results are so rewarding and it can help one grow 
into a better dev. Also, doesn't hurt to get your name and hands into as many projects as possible.
