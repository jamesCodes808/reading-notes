# Hash Tables

## WHY WHAT HOW

## WHY: 
Hash tables are a data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs. 

Hash tables are used because they are:
- Fast and efficient with space time complexity cases when using basic operations (insert, deletes, search)
- Great when storing data with key-value pairs or dictionary objects
- Able to hold various kinds of data types as unique keys

## WHAT:
Utilizing key-value pairs, each `Node` or `Bucket` in a HashTable will have a key and a value.

Through a `hash` HashTables are able to store keys and retrieve the value for that key in a quick manner. 

`Hash` is the ability to encode a key that will point to a specific location in the HashTable. That location can easily be looked up to retrieve the value that belongs to that key, making search operations fast and efficient. 

The process of Hashing is predictable and will always turn the same key into the same integer hash code.
