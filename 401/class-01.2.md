# Engineering

- What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

One thing that I can bring to this career that nobody else can is my positive attitude, vibrant personality, my ambition and willingness to learn and teach others around me to bring success not only to myself but to my colleagues and friends.

- What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

One of the things I am going to start doing is stepping back from the problem and really trying to understand what the problem is before coding it.

Second thing I can start doing is writing out the problem, what goes into the problem, what I expect to happen and the best and worst case scenarios.

Thirdly, I will try to break the problem down into smaller bits, going step by step and ensuring those small steps are functional before moving on, until it is eventually complete.

And if none of these work, I can always comment out that big chunk of spaghetti code and start brand new, not repeating the same code and logic that wasn't working before.
