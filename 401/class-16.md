# Serverless Computing

## What is it?

Serverless computing is a model of cloud computing that allows developers to build and run applications without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. Instead of deploying and managing servers, developers can focus on writing code for specific functions, and the cloud provider takes care of running and scaling the application. 

With serverless computing, developers only pay for the exact amount of computing resources that their application uses, which can lead to cost savings and increased agility. Serverless computing is particularly well-suited for event-driven and microservices architectures.

## Pros 

- Higher developer productivity

- Paying for execution only

- Versatile, develop in any language

- Streamlines development and DevOps cycles.

- Cost effective performances

- Usage visibility

- Improved application quality/performance

- Greater flexibility to scale resources up or down automatically

- Better security of company/customer data

- Better user interfaces since devs can focus exclusively on code

## Cons or challenges to adopting serverless architectures

- Uncertainty regarding the time and costs involved in building applications

- Apps with long-running processes cost more to run in serverless architecture

- Security concerns

- Complexity of serverless architecture

- Lack of control due to vendor lock-in

- Difficulty moving applications from dev/test into production

- Less visibility of back end processes

- Negative impact on performance due to 'cold starts' vs running constantly



## Things I want to know more about

- Want to know how to use serverless computing to connect front end to back end with python and how to create HTTP methods through serverless computing
