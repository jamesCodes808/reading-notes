# How The Web Works

## Class 1 - HTTP, HTML, CSS and JS

### Getting Started

- Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.
```
HTTP, you're so good to me
When i request something
You send it through my TCP/IP
Your language is so confusing
And you work just like a sage
doing magic in the background
to give me a nice webpage
```

- Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

```
The order that the browser parses a webpage is with the HTML file first. As the browser is parsing the HTML file, it will read the metadata in the <head> portion of the HTML file and recognize any <link> and/or <script> elements. 

With this data the browser creates a DOM (Document Object Model) tree from the HTML, CSSOM (CSS Object Model) from the CSS and compiles and executes the JavaScript code.

All of this is combined to instruct the browser how to display the webpage, what the contents are and how it should behave to the user.

```

- How can you find images to add to a Website?

```
There are a couple of different ways to find images to add to a website. 

The most prominent place for any type of image or information is through:
    https://google.com

Some places that I go to get images that are royalty free are:
    https://unsplash.com
    https://blush.design
    https://storyset.com

```

- How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?
```javascript
// Creating a string
let age = "50";

//Creating a number
let age = 50;

In this example, the diffrences between creating a string vs creating a number is the parentheses around the data we are assigning to the variable. 

In a String, we use "parentheses" around the 50, making it a string that will display "50"

In a number, we do NOT use parentheses around the `50` making it a number that we can perform mathematical operations on.
```

- What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

```
When we create variables we are creating and naming containers for data. 

We can store whatever kind of data we need to in these containers and we can manipulate them depending on the type of container it is making it dynamic. 

This is why variables are important.  variables are important to javascript because it allows our programs to be dynamic with data. 
```
