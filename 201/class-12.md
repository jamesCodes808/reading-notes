# Chart.js, Canvas

## JS: Canvas

- What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?

Allows a developer to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.

- What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?

The closing tag is required because whatever is put inside of the `<canvas>` tag will be displayed as fallback content if the browser doesn't support the `<canvas>` element.

- Explain what the `getContext()` method does.

The `getContext()` method returns a rendered context object drawn in the `<canvas>`. It takes one argument such as `'2D'` which will return a 2D redering context object.

## Chart.js
