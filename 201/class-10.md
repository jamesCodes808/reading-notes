# Debugging

## JS: Troubleshooting

- Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

Syntax errors are spelling errors IN your code that actually cause a program to not run at all, it is when you have mistakenly written code wrong and you will know through error messages and markings.

Logic errors are errors in the result OF your code, such as when you write all the code write but for some reason have an infinite loop.

- List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

I have encountered mostly logic errors in my code. Where I was using the wrong variable or was doing the arithmetic wrong. I corrected them by using the console to either find out which line was giving me the error or by console logging the variables to see what was actually being output instead of what i expected.

- How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

This topic will definitely help me troubleshoot my code better, be more thorough with my code instead of rushing through and making mistakes a long the way. 

## JS: Debugger

- How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The way I would describe the javascript debugger tool is like a screen reader but for code. It reads it line by line, and see how the story changes or what happens to the characters (variables) in the story. 

- Define what a breakpoint is.

A breakpoint basically is like a spot in the code where you set kind of like a roadblock for the code to pause executing once it gets to that line. 

- What is the call stack?

A call stack is a section that allows you to see what code was executed to get to the current line, such as a callback function from an event listener.
