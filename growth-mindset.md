# The Growth Mindset

## What the 'Growth Mindset' means to me:
The growth mindset refers to the belief that **a person's abilities and intelligence can be developed and improved through effort and learning**. It is the opposite of a fixed mindset, which is the belief that a person's abilities and intelligence are fixed and cannot be changed. In a growth mindset, a person sees challenges and failures as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than as setbacks. This mindset can lead to a greater sense of resilience and determination, and can ultimately help a person achieve their goals.

## 3 Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:
1. You are never done learning
2. If you're stuck, remember that everyone has been here before
3. It may be uncomfortable and frustrating but it is worth it
