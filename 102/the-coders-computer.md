# The Coder's Most Important Tool, The Text Editor 

## Class 2 - The Coder's Computer

There are several different classifications of text editors, including integrated development environments (IDEs), basic text editors, and code editors. 
IDEs are complex programs that typically include features such as a code editor, a compiler, and a debugger. 
#### Some Popular IDEs Include:
* Microsoft Visual Studio 
* NetBeans
* PyCharm 
* IntelliJ IDEA 
* Eclipse 

The name of code editors and text editors are interchangeable and 
are similar to basic text editors, but they often include additional features such as 
syntax highlighting, themes, code completion and integration with other developer tools such as Ubuntu. 
#### Some Popular Code Editors:
* Visual Studio Code
* Notepad++
* Atom
* Brackets
* Sublime Text

**Basic Text Editors**, on the other hand, are simple
programs that allow users to create and edit plain text files. 
#### Basic Text Editors:
* Notepad
* Microsoft Word
* Wordpad

It is important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of a text editor because the right text editor can make coding more efficient and enjoyable.
For example, a text editor 
with good code completion and syntax highlighting can help developers avoid mistakes and write code faster. An IDE, on the other hand, 
can provide a more comprehensive development environment and streamline the process of writing and debugging code. Ultimately, the right text editor will depend on 
the individual needs and preferences of the developer. Same can be said about the IDE, as the right choice of IDE can provide a developer with a one stop software shop to create whole applications
