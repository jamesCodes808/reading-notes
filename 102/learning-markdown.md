# Reflecting and Discussing Learning GitHub Markdown

## Class 1 - Learning Markdown

GitHub markdown is a simple way to format text and add additional information to your GitHub repositories. As an aspiring developer, I can 
see how it will be incredibly useful for organizing texts and adding readability to project documentation.

A cool feature of GitHub markdown is the ability to add syntax highlighting to code blocks. This is incredibly useful for 
showcasing code examples in a readable and easy-to-understand format, such as:

```javascript
    for(let i=0; i < 10; i++){
    console.log(i);
    }
```
In my previous line of work we had to create a lot of technical 
documentation on a shared onenote. Using Github repos and markdown would have increased the readability of those documents and made 
documentation so much easier to manage. 

In conclusion, GitHub markdown is a valuable tool for improving the organization and readability of your code repositories. It allows you 
to easily format texts and highlight your code, by producing HTML markup
